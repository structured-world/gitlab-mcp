# Prompt Library

Get the best results from GitLab MCP by using well-crafted prompts. This library provides ready-to-use examples organized by workflow.

## How to Get the Best Output

1. **Be specific about the project** — Use full paths: `my-org/backend-api`
2. **Specify the action** — "List", "Create", "Review", "Fix", "Debug"
3. **Add context** — "for code review", "before release", "to debug failure"
4. **Chain requests** — Break complex tasks into sequential steps
5. **Use filters** — Narrow results with state, labels, dates, or assignees

## Quick Examples

### Explore

> "Show me recent merge requests in `my-org/frontend` that need review"

> "List all projects in the `backend` group"

### Code Review

> "Get the diff for MR !42 in `my-org/api` and summarize the key changes"

> "Add a suggestion to fix the null check on line 15 of `src/auth.ts`"

### CI/CD

> "Why did the last pipeline fail in `my-org/api`? Show me the error logs"

> "Retry the failed jobs in pipeline #1234"

### Planning

> "List all open issues in milestone 'v2.0' with their assignees"

> "Create an issue for the login bug we discussed, assign it to @alice"
